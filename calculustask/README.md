# What is the Different between SymPy and SciPy ?

- ## SymPy :
#### 1. SymPy is a Python library for Symbolic Computation in Mathematics.
       Sympy is familiar for open source Symbolic Computation build in python.
       it has too many Symbolic Expression to run like symbolic arithmetic as calculus, algebra,
       discrete mathematics and quantum.
       
#### 2. SymPy can use for a bit Numeric Expression.
       Did you know that ? . The fact that SymPy is not just a Symbol but it can manipulation of
       mathematical expressions like we can do calculate the how much the pi in numeric and more than that.
       
       

- ## SciPy :
#### 1. SciPy is a Python Library for Numerical Computation in Mathematics.
       Scipy is familiar for open source Numerical computation build in Python, Fortran, C, C++.
       it can to 
       
       
#### 2. SciPy can't use for Symbolic Expression.
       The Weakness in SciPy is can't use for Symbolic Expression. Scipy just
