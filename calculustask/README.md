# What is the Different between SymPy and SciPy ?

- ## SymPy :
#### 1. SymPy is a Python library for Symbolic Computation in Mathematics.
       Sympy is familiar for open source Symbolic Computation build in python.
       it has too many Symbolic Expression to run like symbolic arithmetic as calculus, algebra,
       discrete mathematics and quantum.
       Example like if we compute the Integration in SymPy it will calculate with a symbol   
       
#### 2. SymPy can use for a bit Numeric Expression.
       Did you know that ? . The fact that SymPy is not just a Symbol but it can manipulation of
       mathematical expressions like we can do calculate the how much the pi in numeric and more than that.
       
       

- ## SciPy :
#### 1. SciPy is a Python Library for Numerical Computation in Mathematics.
       Scipy is familiar for open source Numerical computation and collection of mathematical algorithms
       build in Python,Fortran, C, C++.
       The numerical is a calculate a mathematics expression like with a number.
       Example like if we compute the Integration in SciPy it will calculate the number
       
       
#### 2. SciPy can't use for Symbolic Expression.
       The Weakness in SciPy is can't use for Symbolic Expression. Scipy only can calculate a number
